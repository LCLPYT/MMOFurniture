A lightweight Fabric port of [Mr Crayfish's Furniture Mod](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark), that aims to provide compatibility for porting worlds created in MinecraftForge with the official Furniture Mod.

## What this mod aims to be
This mod does not aim to be an exact port of the original mod.
It only provides a portion of the blocks, items and entities of the Furniture mod.
The goal of this mod is that worlds, created in MinecraftForge with the original mod,
can be ported to Fabric with ease. A script / mod with instructions, for the conversion process will be
linked here, when it is finished.
